Some of the visual editing tools are created using IPyWidgets, these are available as a Jupyter lab extension. An extension exists to make these widgets accessible in VS Code, and maybe elsewhere. Using Jupyter to view them is preferred. 

Examples 1, 2, and 3 each use MadGraph and Pythia to generate the transverse momenta of tau particles. The examples increase in complexity and are designed to serve as an introduction to mg5qs. Example 3 presents the complete, intended code pattern, benefiting from all the advantages offered by mg5qs.
